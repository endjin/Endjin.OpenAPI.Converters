# OpenAPI.Document.Converters
A Visual Studio 2017 Custom Tool that converts between OpenAPI formats:

- to OpenAPI 2.0 JSON - Set Custom Tool to "ConvertToOpenApi_2_0_Json"
- to OpenAPI 2.0 YAML - Set Custom Tool to "ConvertToOpenApi_2_0_Yaml"
- to OpenAPI 3.0 JSON - Set Custom Tool to "ConvertToOpenApi_3_0_Json"
- to OpenAPI 3.0 YAML - Set Custom Tool to "ConvertToOpenApi_3_0_Yaml"

The primary usage scenario for this tool is the authoring of OpenAPI files in local Azure Function projects.
